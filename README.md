#  Classification of Arrhythmia by Using Deep Learning with 2-D ECG Spectral Image Representation
## IBM-Project-5048-1658746665

Over 17 million people die each year from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the main cause of death in humans. Three-fourths of all CVD deaths, according to the World Heart Federation, occur in the low- and middle-income groups of the population. By offering prompt treatment, a classification model to detect CVDs in their early stages could significantly lower the mortality rate. Cardiac arrhythmia, in which heartbeats are known to deviate from their regular beating pattern, is one of the common causes of CVDs.
