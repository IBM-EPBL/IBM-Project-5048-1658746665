#  Classification of Arrhythmia by Using Deep Learning with 2-D ECG Spectral Image Representation
## IBM-Project-5048-1658746665

Over 17 million people die each year from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the main cause of death in humans. Three-fourths of all CVD deaths, according to the World Heart Federation, occur in the low- and middle-income groups of the population. By offering prompt treatment, a classification model to detect CVDs in their early stages could significantly lower the mortality rate. Cardiac arrhythmia, in which heartbeats are known to deviate from their regular beating pattern, is one of the common causes of CVDs.

These deviations indicate numerous heart arrhythmia types and can be divided into multiple subclasses. The diagnosis and management of people with cardiac disease could be aided by an accurate classification of these categories. Arrhythmia can refer to irregular heartbeats or to patterns that cannot be explained by a regular heartbeat. In clinical practise, an automated detection of such patterns is extremely important.

## Workflow

- User uploads the ECG image using the User Interface (UI)
- Uploaded image is analyzed by the classification model integrated with the webpage
- Once model analyses the uploaded image, the predicted category is showcased on the webpage
